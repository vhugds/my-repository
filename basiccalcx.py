#step1: create a folder with the name of the project.e.g(calculator.py)using the .py helps you to know it is a python fil
#step2: open the folder with your vscode or any other programming app
#step3: create a file; at the left hand side of ur vscode u see a tool for creating file end ur file with .py to tell vscode it is a python file
#step4: create a function that adds two numbers together.
#step4a: create a function with a variable name.
#step4b: use the return keyword to add two numbers together.
#step5: create a function that substracts two number together.
#step5a: create a  function with a variable name.
#step5b: use the return keyword to substract two numbers together
#step6: create a function that multiply two numbers together.
#step6a: create a function with a variable name.
#step6b: use the return keyword to multiply two numbers together.
#step7: create a function that divide two numbers together.
#step7a: create a function with a variable name.
#step7b: use the return keyword to divide two numbers together.
#step8: prompt the user to select opration from(add,subtract,divide,multiply).
#step9: if user select add call the addition function.
#step9a: initialize two variable num1 and num2.
#step9b: get values for each of the variable and store them respectively.
#step9c: add num1 to num2
#step9d: return the result
#step10: if user select substract call the substraction function.
#step10a: initialize two variable num1 and num2.
#step10b: get values for each of the variable and store them respectively.
#step10c: add num1 to num2
#step10d: return the result
#step11:if user select multiply call the multiplication function.
#step11a: initialize two variable num1 and num2.
#step11b: get values for each of the variable and store them respectively.
#step11c: add num1 to num2
#step11d: return the result
#step12: if user select divide call the division function.
#step12a: initialize two variable num1 and num2.
#step12b: get values for each of the variable and store them respectively.
#step12c: add num1 to num2
#step12d: return the result
#step13: ask if the user wants more calculation with a yes or no tag.
#step14: if user selects yes continue the loop from "step7".
#   else break the loop.
